# p5jsTankGame

With P5JS library I created a 2 player game, in which two tanks try to shoot each other. The tanks
are constantly in motion and the players steer them using keys. The shells come out of the tanks
have a limited range and a player can only fire 4 of them consecutively.

Steering and reappearing on the map after crossing the border need improvements.
